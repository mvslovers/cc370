   `ld`).  Pull the crt0 startup as the first object (so the @@CRT0 startup is at
   module offset 0), set the entry to @@CRT0, and emit no -lgcc -- the crent libc
   (libc.a) carries the compiler-support routines, so there is no separate
   libgcc.  crt0.o / libc.a live in the sysroot lib, found via the -L paths the

/* Emit fixed-column, blank-delimited assembler text instead of the back
   end's tab-separated layout.  The crent370 / MVS 3.8j tool chain assembles
   the output with IFOX00 (Assembler XF), which does not treat the horizontal
   tab as a field separator, so tab-separated output fails with "IFO053 OP
   CODE NOT FOUND" on every statement.  The implementation lives in
   config/i370/i370.c, fenced by this same macro.  Remove this define once the
   tool chain emits object code (or feeds an assembler that accepts tabs) and
   the column text is no longer needed.  */

#define I370_IFOX_COLUMNS 1

/* Do not materialise string constants via store_by_pieces / move-by-pieces
   immediates.  The generic builtin expanders (memcpy / mempcpy / strncpy of a
   string literal in config/../builtins.c) can copy the literal's bytes
   straight into immediate operands (e.g. MVC 0(4,r),=F'<word>').  Those bytes
   are the host (ASCII) representation of the string, whereas the constant pool
   is assembled by IFOX00 from C'...' text and is therefore EBCDIC.  Inlining
   thus emits e.g. "ARRY" as ASCII 0x41525259 while every comparison against
   the pooled C'ARRY' sees EBCDIC 0xC1D9D9E8, so the two never match.

   Defining this macro fences off those store_by_pieces paths so the copy falls
   back to emit_block_move / a library call, which reads the in-memory (EBCDIC)
   literal -- matching the gccmvs 3.2.3 (c2asm370) behaviour the crent370
   runtime was built and validated against.  Fenced by this same macro in
   config/i370/builtins paths; defined only here (mvspdp).  */
