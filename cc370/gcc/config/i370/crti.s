#
# This file just supplies function prologues for the .init and .fini
# sections.  It is linked in before crtbegin.o. It is supposed to
# provide a standard function prolog; users can put "anything" in
# here. _init is (supposed to be) called directly from _start
# (crt0.s or crt1.s provided by the C library). The _fini is
# called by atexit() from crt0.s/crt1.s.
#
# crti.s contains the prologues to these two sections, and crtn.s
# contains the epilogs. STARTFILE_SPEC should list crti.o before
# any other object files that might add code to .init or .fini
# sections, and ENDFILE_SPEC should list crtn.o after any such object
# files
#
# I have no clue if this is correct.
